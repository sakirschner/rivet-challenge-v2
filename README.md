# Rivet Code Challenge

This application was developed by Scott Kirschner for the Rivet front-end developer challenge. 

## Getting Started

- Clone the project and run `npm install` from the root directory.
- In the root directory create a file called `.env.local` and be sure to put the period in the begining of the file name. 
    - This file stores the API token in order to make calls to the API and is included in the gitignore for security purposes.
- In `.env.local` add the following:

    ```
    REACT_APP_API_TOKEN=<Your API Token>
    ```
- From the root directory run `npm start`
